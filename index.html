            <p>I currently head the Biometrics department in a mid-sized, early-phase Pharmaceutical CRO. Previously, I worked
                as a Statistician, and also as a Bio-computing Applications Developer in the medical research and pharmaceutical
                space. I obtained my masters in Statistics, and my bachelors in Statistics and Biochemistry, both from the
                University of Toronto.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy tackling data science problems, reading, tennis and spending time with my daughter Marissa.
                I'm also broadly interested in AI, Cloud Computing, Web and Mobile technologies, and in their potential to
                solve pressing, real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I'm an aspiring web and app developer, who's always ready to take on any challenging, freelance projects. Free
                free to shoot me an email with your request.</p>
